# Restaurant Desktop APP

#### Problem to solve

A restaurant needs to keep track on how many ingredients it has left in stock after each order has been placed.
They also want to know how many times a recipe has been ordered.
You are being tasked with building a ui that will let management keep track of these things.

Although management is willing to give you creative freedom they do have certain demands and requirements:

Main requirements(Actual assignment): <br/>
1 - Management is a big fan of Facebook and has heard of this thing called React so they want you to use it<br/>
2 - Management wants to be able to see in the same screen pending orders and items inventory<br/>
3 - Management would like to have a top bar where the number of cancelled, pending, in progress and fulfilled orders is visible<br/>
4 - An order should not be created if not all the items are in stock<br/>

Nice to Have Requirements:<br/>
1 - Management has read some tech blogs and learned about TypeScript and would like it to be used<br/>
1 - Management likes filtering things, so he would like to be able to filter the items by color;<br/>
2 - Management wants to be able to cancel an order that is in pending state within 3 minutes of the order being created.<br/>
3 - An order should be in pending state when first created and transitioned into in progress state after 3 minutes of being created.<br/>

All this is supported by the apis the manager wrote and the documentation can be found here
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/d65yan/restaurant/0.0.0

The Manager does not have a development environment so anything you can do to make it easier to view the code and the running result would be highly appreciated.
